                    This is an essay I wrote for my Syracuse University Project Advanced (SUPA) Reading class. This
                    essay explores the themes of violence, loss of faith, and rebellion in Marjane Satrapi's graphic
                    memoir Persepolis, which recounts her experiences as a child during the Iranian Revolution. It
                    examines the intersection of religion, politics, and personal growth as Satrapi navigates the
                    turbulent environment of 1980s Iran. Through an innocent childhood lens, the essay delves into her
                    evolving relationship with faith—initially a source of comfort and guidance—and the profound impact
                    of political repression, violence, and personal loss on her identity. The analysis also highlights
                    Satrapi's transformation into a rebellious young woman, challenging oppressive societal norms and
                    finding her voice against tyranny. The essay situates Persepolis as a powerful narrative that sheds
                    light on the struggles of Iranian women and the enduring fight for freedom and rights in the face of
                    systemic oppression.

                    “We actually have a monopoly not only on legitimate violence, which is what
                    every nation states leaders have, but now, also the values that we are saying
                    come from our faith, as well.”
                    —Arzoo Osanloo, “The Woman Question”
                    <br>
                    At age fourteen, most teens start high school, get their first phone, attend sports games, and
                    concerts, however, young women in Iran are fighting for their rights per diem. Iranian
                    illustrator and novelist Marjane Satrapi, recounts her experiences as a child during the 1980’s
                    Revolution in Iran in her autobiography Persepolis. Using a graphic novel as a format for an
                    extensive memoir of her childhood in Iran evokes a deeper understanding of violence through the
                    perspective of a child. The cruel regulation of women in Iran accelerated when Ahmadinejad
                    became president: “he actually campaigns on this platform that really speaks to a greater
                    emphasis on so-called traditional roles, what some people might call conservative roles, of
                    women as nurturers, raising the children and guiding the family” (Abdelfatah). Traditional
                    values were taught to be the right way and any who opposed them were “Western puppets”
                    (Abdelfatah). The morality police were created to enforce these traditional ideas. They often
                    harass, arrest, and harm women who do not follow the strict dress and social codes dictated by
                    the Iranian clerics: “Iran's morality police force was established in the 1990s to enforce
                    social rules, like proper hijab for women. Under the Ahmadinejad administration, they became
                    more aggressive in their enforcement, which included arrests, alleged beatings and sometimes
                    lashings” (Abdelfatah). With women at the forefront of the movement against the Shah, even the
                    youngest of girls are called upon to recognize the treachery of their country’s leaders and rise
                    to fight for the rights of their friends, mothers, sisters, and daughters. Satrapi explores the
                    relationship between religion as a source of comfort and violence during the Iranian Revolution
                    through an innocent childhood perspective.
                    <br>
                    In the chapter The Bicycle, Satrapi introduces the role of God and religion in her childhood as
                    a source of comfort and admiration prior to the inception of the violent revolution; however,
                    Satrapi’s childhood innocence falls victim to the increasingly dangerous political climate. In
                    NPR Thouroughline’s podcast episode “The Woman Question” host Rund Abdelfatah provides important
                    historical context: “For hundreds of years, Iran was ruled by some kind of shah. A king after
                    king, ruler after ruler, dominated the country. But in the early 20th century, something
                    changed. Between 1905 and 1911, Iran experienced its first modern political revolution”
                    (Abdelfatah). Satrapi was 10 years old in 1980, one year into the Islamic Revolution. Satrapi’s
                    mother, a powerful and loving woman, protested for women’s rights in Iran leading Satrapi to
                    aspire to follow in her footsteps and become a prophet. Her desire to become a prophet to save
                    her people, reflects her faith and loyalty to her God and her religion. Satrapi’s parents are
                    Marxists and religious; she manifests these beliefs as an imaginary friend offering guidance and
                    support. Still unsure of who she is, she relies on her parents to define her as she navigates
                    through her identity and sense of self. Rocio G. Davis, an associate professor of American and
                    postcolonial literature at the University of Navarra, highlights the intentional artistic
                    liberties Satrapi incorporated into her novel: “Her early representation of herself stresses the
                    happy contradictions that often exist in a child's perception of the world, as well as the more
                    insidious conflicts between her home life– her parents are Marxists who encourage their child's
                    intellectual development– and public life that includes the pain that a repressive government
                    causes” (Davis). There are several contrasts to make between the different worlds she lives
                    during her early childhood. The contrast between Marx and God is an example of this
                    juxtaposition. Satrapi illustrates a binary between two mentors influenced by her parent’s
                    beliefs, God and Karl Marx emphasizing their similarities in appearance and in her life:
                    <br>
                    [Visual figures in the text were referenced here.]
                    <br>
                    Satrapi refers to the figure as God which highlights her prioritization of her faith rather than
                    political beliefs:
                    <br>
                    At this point in her childhood, Satrapi is faithful to her religion and relies on God for
                    assurance and enlightenment. The dark tides of the revolution have not yet seeped into the
                    cracks of her immature mind.
                    <br>
                    However, as the book progresses, Satrapi's perception of her religion and God evolves into one
                    of conflict and disappointment due to the violent and repressive actions justified under
                    religious authority. The Islamic Revolution’s impact on women becomes an unignorable force in
                    her life. In her memoir, the representation of the mandatory veiling is powerful: “We found
                    ourselves veiled and separated from our friends” (Satrapi). For a child, such sudden and drastic
                    impositions feel suffocating. While religion initially brought comfort, it now becomes a symbol
                    of enforced conformity and violence. This transformation is evident in her distancing from God
                    as a confidant and her increasing reliance on her own agency and observations.
                    <br>
                    Satrapi’s graphic novel effectively portrays the personal ramifications of systemic oppression
                    through visual and narrative storytelling. Her juxtaposition of innocence with the brutality of
                    the regime allows readers to feel the weight of historical events on individuals' lives. By
                    presenting her perspective as a child, Satrapi invites readers to question the intersections of
                    faith, governance, and personal identity. The stark black-and-white illustrations further
                    underline the contrasts and binary struggles she faces. Through her work, Satrapi gives voice to
                    the many women whose lives were forever changed by the Iranian Revolution, making Persepolis not
                    just a memoir but a significant historical and cultural critique.
