                Astrology offers those in crisis the comfort of imagining a better future, a tangible reminder of that
                clichéd truism that is nonetheless hard to remember when you’re in the thick of it: This too shall pass.

                Digital natives were either exposed to modern technology and social media at a developmental age or grew
                up with it their whole lives. As a digital native, I encounter astrology on social media daily. The
                medium in which I consume astrology content is often artificial and hedonistic: stroking the ego,
                providing general and broad assumptions on character, or associating entirely irrelevant facts with your
                zodiac sign. The abundance of posts influenced my self-esteem and perception of myself, encouraging
                comparison of myself to others associated with more desirable traits.

                <br>
                Though not yet proven to be scientifically based, astrology may have psychological applications as a
                coping mechanism for the overstimulated and overstressed minds of Generation Z and Millennials.

                <br>
                Astrology remains the target of academics, skeptics, and astrologists inquiring as to the scientific
                validity and applicability of astrology in people's daily lives. Although many astrologists attempted to
                prove the scientific validity of astrology, it is still regarded as a "pseudoscience." Common arguments
                of astrology skeptics include: astrology is founded in magic and superstition, there is no scientific
                basis for astrology, and why are zodiac signs determined at birth and not conception? (Dean 166). In
                layman's terms, astrology is a pseudoscience studying the planets and Zodiac and its correlation to
                personality and identity.

                <br>
                Some notable astrologists include Michel Gauquelin, Dane Rudhyar, Geoffrey Dean, and Arthur Mather.
                Gauquelin, Dean, Rudhyar, and Mather are all astrologists with published work from the 1970s to 1990s.
                Dean and Mather focused more on damning evidence astrology is accurate and would often publish biased
                work. Gauquelin objectively looked at the data and research and was often critical of astrology though
                being an astrologer. Rudhyar connected the psyche to astrology and often wrote more about the
                psychological influences of astrology instead of its scientific validity regarding the planets. However,
                the consumption of astrology has changed today.

                <br>
                Astrology, in its watered-down state, can manipulate how people perceive themselves and others through
                their zodiac signs. Although astrology today is not entirely representative of its predecessor, it still
                has influence and intrigue among astrologists and others. The primary consumers of 21st-century
                astrology are Millennials (born 1981 to 1996) and Gen Z (born 1997 to 2010).

                <h4>Where did astrology originate?</h4>
                <br>
                Astrology originated as a tool for early civilizations to navigate the land and tell time with the lunar
                phases. Archeologists and scientists first discovered evidence of astrology through cave paintings from
                30,000 – 10,000 B.C. ("How it Began"). From 300 B. C. to the 5th Century A.D., the Greeks made
                significant advances in astrology and named the planets and zodiac signs figures from Greek mythology
                and literature. An astrology work, Tetrabiblos, published by Ptolemy, contained information about
                planets, zodiac signs, houses, and aspects astrologists still use today ("How it Began").

                <br>
                The 12 zodiac signs, constellations determined by their date and relationship between the sun and the
                sky, include Ares, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius,
                and Pisces. Astrologists determine personality and other patterns through one's natal chart. A natal
                chart consists of twelve houses that define the aspects of life that the main zodiac sign (sun sign)
                does not include. Some houses have the house of self, the house of family and home, the house of
                communication, etc. Astrologists use these signs to determine essential information about personality or
                read their horoscopes/fate.

                <h4>What have studies on astrology shown?</h4>
                In 1978, Michel Gauquelin (French astrologer, psychologist, and writer) and several other academic peers
                studied astrology's validity, concerning behavior and the Zodiac. Utilizing keywords and traits about
                each of the 12 Zodiac signs from eight books written and published by esteemed astrologers, they
                determined key terms, compared them to a sample group of 2,000 subjects, and extracted 52,188
                personality traits from each of their published biographies and autobiographies. They juxtaposed the
                traits to each author's sun, moon, and ascendant signs. They calculated the expected frequency by
                dividing the attributes collected from the biographies of a specific sign and multiplying it by the
                number of traits from the 52,188 the researchers believe aligned with that particular sign. The
                researchers conducted the experiment seeking "how many times are actual horoscopic frequencies greater
                than (+) or less than (-) expected for each sign at the birth of people described by the keywords
                applied to that sign?" (Gauquelin 61). They predicted the results would produce 48 positive and 48
                negative results (96 trials with 12 signs and eight astrologers); however, the results proved
                disheartening: "No sign scores significantly higher than expected by chance. The "bad" value of Libra
                has no more significance than the relatively "good" value of Aquarius" (Gauquelin 61). The results did
                not show a trend in either the positive or negative direction— everything was up to chance.
                <br>
                Gauquelin found several psychological contradictions within the results: "the keywords of the aggressive
                and passionate Aries and Scorpio correspond to a maximum of subjects born with the sun in Cancer, a
                sensitive and dreamy sign; and so forth" (Gauquelin 62). The traits used to describe particular signs
                seemed to align more with subjects of other signs— even seemingly opposite characteristics such as
                "aggressive" and "sensitive."
                <br>
                As a pseudoscience, astrology suggests scientific validity, but astrologists have yet to prove it's a
                tried and true science. The results of Gauquelin's study enforce the falsity and inconsistency of
                astrology: "The results of our study are clear-cut and need few comments. There is no correlation
                between character traits of the subjects and the signs under which they were born" (Gauquelin 64). The
                experiment concluded no correlation: the data had dubiously confirmed the falsity of astrological
                influence on personality and behavior.
                <br>
                On the other hand, Dean argues the impossibility of “proving” the existence or validity of astrology
                scientifically: "We may note that, if subjects do not know themselves, then valid personality
                questionnaires could not exist. Nor could astrologers ever know that astrology works" (Dean 180).
                Studies comparing the Zodiac and personality can only be valid if people know themselves well. Subjects
                in experiments attempting to discern the correlation between Zodiac and personality may think of
                themselves in a certain way which may contradict the Zodiac yet be utterly false in determining
                character through Zodiac.
                <br>
                Despite countless studies and empirical research disproving the science of astrology, astrologists
                continue to pursue their own "truth" of astrology and believe in the signs. In 1978, Dean advertised a
                £500 prize to whoever could produce irrefutable evidence proving astrology was scientifically based
                (Gauquelin 64). Despite his efforts, the results were fruitless, and the Zodiac and astrology have yet
                to have empirical evidence of its factuality in science. The Zodiac appears not to influence behavior,
                yet people still research a non-existent correlation.
                <br>
                Considering everything, Gauquelin was not hopeful for the future of astrology. Time and time again,
                astrologists failed to yield indisputable evidence supporting the scientific validity of astrology: "Of
                course, despite the pressure of the facts, almost all of the astrologers are still continuing to believe
                in signs. They are wondering how they could survive, as practitioners, a horoscope without a zodiac. For
                our part, we are wondering how the horoscope itself could survive such a fatal blow" (Gauquelin 64).
                <br>
                Despite his doubts, astrology and the Zodiac still exist today and live on through social media and the
                internet. But this raises the question: why do we believe in astrology?
                <h4>Why do we believe in astrology?</h4>
                Despite the overwhelming evidence grounding astrology as a pseudoscience, countless people still follow
                the teachings and signs of astrology today. A portion of astrology consumers believe astrology is rooted
                in science; however, most see it as a symbolic tool.
                <br>
                People take astrology very seriously; paradoxically, that does not mean they believe in it: "It's a tool
                for self-reflection, it's not a religion or a science. It's just a way to look at the world and a way to
                think about things" (Beck). Astrology is similar to faith or religion; used as a tool for moral guidance
                and support in difficult times. People do not need empirical evidence to believe in astrology because it
                stems from individual faith.
                <br>
                In a survey conducted in 1984, F. Fullam collected the reasons people believe in astrology using all
                available opinion polls from Western countries (Dean 175). Her conclusion was "people believe in
                astrology because it is satisfying on many levels, from the trivial to the profound. Some use it as
                entertainment. Some use it to solve problems ("Is he right for me?"). Some use it to discover the sacred
                meaning of life" (Dean 175). There are countless reasons and layers to astrology believers. Some may
                take it seriously; others may use it solely for entertainment; the Zodiac or horoscopes hold no weight
                in their lives at all. It is a source for answers or a higher power. Although it is not a religion,
                there is an aspect of faith and unrequited belief in astrology.
                <h4>How has astrology influenced people in teh 21st century?</h4>
                Much research on the validity and utility of astrology was published in the 20th century; an abundance
                of sources analyzing or criticizing astrology in the 21st century or digital age does not exist.
                However, astrology plays an equally important role in society today as it did fifty years ago. Social
                media and the internet have launched astrology into the mainstream; however, the mass attraction to
                astrology has also attracted countless frauds. Social media accounts and fake tarot readers and
                proclaimed psychics and astrologists. Similarly to Dean, Julie Beck, senior editor at The Atlantic,
                argues that astrology serves a more psychological benefit and does not suggest astrology is entirely
                factual:
                <br>
                QUOTE While there are surely some people who blindly accept astrology as fact and view it as on par with
                a
                discipline like biology, that doesn’t seem to be the case among many of the young adults who are fueling
                this renaissance of the zodiac. The people I spoke to for this piece often referred to astrology as a
                tool, or a kind of language—one that, for many, is more metaphorical than literal (Beck).
                <br>
                Diluted horoscopes and astrology are prevalent on social media; however, it provides guidance and
                comfort to the followers though they may not believe it's scientific.
                <br>
                Astrology in the 21st century is "fake but true" (Beck). Although this statement is contradictory it
                reveals the contradiction in the target audience of astrology and Zodiac online. From her research, Beck
                argues that "digital natives are narcissistic," and astrology is a self-indulgent obsession (Beck).
                Others may "feel powerless here on Earth," so they find guidance and strength by "turning to the stars"
                (Beck). It serves as an escape from the crippling reality of today and as a source of order and
                stability in a world of chaos.
                <h4>How can astrology be beneficial for stress and mental health?</h4>
                Although astrology has yet to be proven scientifically, countless astrologists and followers of
                astrology still uphold their beliefs. However, Dean proposes that astrology may not need to be true. He
                argues that although astrology could be factual, it has the potential to serve a psychological purpose.
                People who seek guidance or comfort can turn to astrology for advice. If a subject believes in
                astrology, their horoscope or advice provided by a professional astrologist may benefit them mentally
                and psychologically:
                <br>
                QUOTE: Mayer (1978), a humanistic psychotherapist and astrologer, extends Skafte's sun-sign approach to
                include
                all of astrology. His concern is to help clients confused about their identity and seeking a meaning in
                life. He argues that this is difficult via the orthodox personality theories used to guide therapy, but
                easy via the imagery and complexity of astrology without requiring it to be true. For this purpose he
                proposes a new kind of astrology for which no claims of validity are made, and which is contraindicated
                for clients opposed to non rational approaches or over inclined to fantasy. (Dean 172)
                <br>
                Astrology can provide comfort and solace during tried times and stimulate meaningful connections,
                conversations, and relationships. Assumptions based on or attributed to astrology can create closeness
                on a shared topic, behavior, or interest. It can also make a person feel unique and meaningful, even if
                what the astrologist is saying may not be entirely accurate:
                <br>
                QUOTE Skafte (1969), a psychologist and counselor, tested the effect of introducing popular astrology
                (and palmistry and numerology) into personal and vocational counseling, for example, by saying "a person
                born under your sign is supposed to enjoy travel—does this sound like you?" The words were chosen to
                avoid implying validity and to promote dialogue. She found that: (1) this provides a focal point for
                discussion that often stimulates clients to talk openly about themselves, (2) mutual interest in an
                unconventional activity quickly creates closeness and rapport that would otherwise take many sessions to
                establish, (3) the focus on individual qualities (as opposed to, say, impersonal questionnaires), meets
                the client's need to feel special (Dean 172).
                <br>
                Although most assumptions decided by astrology are broad and nonspecific, they are both general enough
                and different from other zodiac sign readings for people to derive a sense of individuality and
                specialness from the Zodiac. The Zodiac and horoscopes are inherently narcissistic— it panders to the
                individual and provides context and other information specific to that person. It makes people feel seen
                and understood as individuals. It creates a mindset in which they look at themselves introspectively to
                identify positive and negative aspects and what sets them apart from others.
                <br>
                Astrologists can serve a similar role to psychotherapists depending on how they utilize the Zodiac to
                support their patients:
                <br>
                QUOTE Lester (1982), a professor of psychology in the United States, visited an astrologer, talked to
                clients of astrologers, and surveyed astrological writings. He concluded: (1) Astrologers play a role
                similar to that of psychotherapists. (2) People consult astrologers for the same reason they consult
                psychotherapists, but without the stigma the latter may entail. (3) Clients get empathy, advice,
                compliments (which increase self-esteem), and positive comments about possible future traumas, all of
                which amounts to supportive psychotherapy (Dean 171).
                <br>
                As mentioned previously, the Zodiac panders to individuals and provides an ego boost or a boost in
                self-esteem. A professional can use the Zodiac to guide their patient through difficult times by
                providing advice, guidance, and compliments. However, can believing in astrology go too far? When does
                astrology become harmful as opposed to helpful?
                <h4>How can astrology be harmful?</h4>
                Although astrology and Zodiac can help people in times of distress, they may cause them to believe false
                assumptions about their personality or future. It can cause codependency with the type of comfort and
                confidence astrology can create. With social media today, it is effortless to compare themselves with
                others. The Zodiac and astrology on social media often display significant pandering, which can cause
                false confidence or delusion.
                <br>
                Buzzfeed, a popular media and entertainment website, is infamous for its niche quizzes and proclaimed
                astrological foresight. Their homepage is saturated with thousands of articles, quizzes, and videos on
                astrology— they all claim to know some unfathomable information about the reader, connecting to their
                astrological sign.
                <br>
                Companies like Buzzfeed make money off of advertising and clicks on their articles. These eye-catching
                headlines and claims state they know who you will marry, your eye color, how old you are, what your best
                features are, etc., all based on your zodiac sign. These aspects of self are unequivocally impossible to
                discern from the ten to twenty random questions they ask on quizzes or personality traits they associate
                with each zodiac sign.
                <br>
                Buzzfeed is not only profiting off of a scam, but the results of these articles and quizzes can produce
                adverse effects on a frequent consumer of this media. Consumers indulging in the individualistic
                disposition of most astrology-based content on social media potentially create harmful behavior towards
                themselves and others. Comparing the attributes of your zodiac sign to another develops feelings of
                jealousy or even disgust. For extreme astrology followers, a person's astrological sign can determine
                the difference between love and hatred. This creates subconscious discrimination against people for
                something out of their control.

                The ceaseless barrage of self-serving, egotistical affirmations can cause an individual to become
                delusional. They can attribute all their harmful behaviors and traits to their astrological sign,
                therefore, forfeiting all responsibility to better themselves. This attribution bias can affect the
                individual's self-image and relationships. Arguably, constant validation and compliments can benefit
                self-esteem; it can create an unhealthy dependence on the type of content they consume.
                <h4>What remains unknown about astrology?</h4>
                Astrologists continue to search for scientific evidence to prove the existence of astrology as an
                indiscriminate way of determining personality or fate. People still believe in astrology and apply it to
                their own lives, even making a career out of it. Astrology will remain a mystical force in people’s
                lives and will live on through social media.

                Psychologists and psychotherapists may employ the ideals of the Zodiac within patient sessions and find
                it helpful. There are no known practices of astrology in psychotherapy today, but most evidence suggests
                that it is worth researching.

                The people whose horoscopes come true not because the planets and the stars said they would but because
                they believe it will come true and, by doing so, indirectly manifest their desires. Manifesting and fate
                may have a whole other science entirely.

                Julie Beck, a senior writer at The Atlantic, writes about the presence of astrology in the 21st century
                and what it represents to its followers today. Social media and the internet has launched astrology into
                the mainstream, however, with the mass attraction to astrology, it has also attracted countless frauds.
                Horoscopes and astrology are prevalent on social media and have been diluted from its original forms,
                however, it provides guidance and comfort to the followers though they may not believe it’s scientific.
                Beck proposes that modern astrology, though widespread, is not necessarily believed to be true. Most
                people consuming astrology is as a form of guidance or entertainment, not necessarily advice or
                premonitions.

                In the academic journal the Skeptical Inquirer, Michel Gauquelin, French astrologist, psychologist, and
                writer, reports his findings on the relationship between the Zodiac and personality in an article titled
                “Zodiac and Personality: An Empirical Study”. The Zodiac is the arrangement of the sun, moon, and
                planets divided into 12 categories. Astrologists like Gauquelin believe there is a correlation between
                the zodiac sign you are born under and your personality. The experiment was conducted using 50,000
                character traits and 2,000 subjects (taking their personality data from their biographies). Despite the
                grand experiment sample, the results showed no correlation between the Zodiac and personality and even
                found some subject’s personality traits directly contradicted their sign. Although the conclusion of his
                study directly opposed his beliefs on astrology, Gauquelin used this opportunity to discuss the
                importance of publishing research regarding astrology that may or may not support the researcher’s
                beliefs.

                British astrologer and writer Geoffrey Dean contributes a chapter called “Does Astrology Need To Be
                True? Part 1: A Look at the Real Thing” in the Hundredth Monkey, a book containing a variety of articles
                on science and philosophy. Dean argues the validity versus the utility of astrology. Astrology has yet
                to be proven scientific but that does not exhume the fact that it still may be truthful. But astrology
                may not need to be scientific because it can provide advice and comfort to those seeking guidance from a
                celestial body. People who seek guidance or comfort can turn to astrology. More novel things such as
                newspaper horoscopes and misguided predictions can not be identified as proper astrology. False claims
                on the grounds of astrology do not incriminate the validity of astrology however it may affect people’s
                reliability on it.
