            <div class="text">Sydney Tsin is a second-year Computer Science student pursuing an accelerated BS/MS in
                Computer Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). She actively pursues opportunities in
                software
                engineering and programming to enhance her technical and soft skills. She is passionate about community,
                creativity,
                and computing. Eager to forge connections and relationships, Sydney seeks to grow and explore more about
                the world and herself. <br>
                As a Residential Advisor, she has developed a strong sense of community among her
                residents, providing support and leadership. Sydney is also creative, expressing herself through fashion
                and art,
                engaging in painting, drawing, makeup, tabletop role playing games, and cosplay.<br>
                Her commitment to computing is evident through her involvement in the Women in
                Computing club at RIT, where she advocates for women and gender minorities, fosters connections, and
                strengthens her
                community with like-minded individuals. Sydney has gained coding experience in Java, Python, HTML, CSS,
                TypeScript,
                and C, with Java being her strongest language. She has completed projects using JavaFX, JUnit, JApplet,
                and REST
                API. In addition, she has worked on projects involving Angular CLI, Godot, and Git for version control
                and
                is familiar with Scrum and Agile processes. Sydney utilizes Microsoft and Google Suites in her school
                assignments and
                her role as a Student Assistant for Clubs and Organizations at the Center for Campus Life at RIT. <br>
                She aims to secure an internship or co-op to further develop her technical skills,
                build meaningful connections, gain professional experience, advocate for inclusivity and diversity in
                tech spaces,
                and reinforce her passions for computing, community, and creativity.
