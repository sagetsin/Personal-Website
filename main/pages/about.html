            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <div class="text">Sydney Tsin is a second-year Computer Science student pursuing an accelerated BS/MS in Computer Science
                at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). She actively pursues opportunities in software engineering and
                programming to enhance her technical and soft skills. She is passionate about community, creativity, and
                computing. Eager to forge connections and relationships, Sydney seeks to grow and explore more about the
                world and herself.

            <div class="text">As a Residential Advisor, she has developed a strong sense of community among her residents, providing
                support and leadership. Sydney is also creative, expressing herself through fashion and art, engaging in
                painting, drawing, makeup, tabletop role playing games, and cosplay.

            </div>

            <div class="text"> Her commitment to computing is evident through her involvement in the Women in Computing club at RIT,
                where she advocates for women and gender minorities, fosters connections, and strengthens her community with
                like-minded individuals. Sydney has gained coding experience in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and C, with
                Java being her strongest language. She has completed projects using JavaFX, JUnit, JApplet, and REST API. In
                addition, she has worked on projects involving Angular CLI, Godot, and Git for version control and is familiar with
                Scrum and Agile processes. Sydney utilizes Microsoft and Google Suites in her school assignments and her role as a
                Student Assistant for Clubs and Organizations at the Center for Campus Life at RIT.

                She aims to secure an internship or co-op to further develop her technical skills, build meaningful
                connections, gain professional experience, advocate for inclusivity and diversity in tech spaces, and reinforce her
                passions for computing, community, and creativity.
