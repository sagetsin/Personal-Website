                    Wizard Battle is a Game that allows a <em>Player</em> to play a <em>Wizard</em> and unlock three
                    other
                    <em>Wizards</em> to fight off <em>Monsters</em> in a turn-based RPG-style battle. There are three
                    types of <em>Monsters</em>
                    from level 1 to level 3 difficulty and the final boss.

                    A Player can increase the level of a Wizard by +1 after defeating three level 1 Monsters defeating
                    two level 2 Monsters, or one level 3 Monster. Each Monster has its own vulnerabilities to certain
                    elemental types and resistances. A Player can take a possibility of 6 actions during a battle: swap
                    Wizard, check vulnerability, check resistance, use a special skill, skip a turn, or forfeit;
                    however, they can only choose one. The Monster will still attack regardless of the action they take
                    during their turn. They can also use their special skill which will cause a Monster to be vulnerable
                    to a specific element at level 4. When hit with an elemental type a Monster is vulnerable to, they
                    will deal double damage. When hit with an elemental type a Monster is resistant to, they will deal
                    half damage.
                    <br>
                    A Wizard can have a level from 1-5. Each Wizard can cast Spells of a specific elemental type. Each
                    wizard has three Spells: a level 1 Spell, a level 2 Spell, and a level 3 Spell. The Player has
                    access to their level 1 Spell from levels 1-5, level 2 Spells from 2-5, and level 3 Spells from 4-5.
                    A Wizard can only cast a level 3 Spell twice per battle, a level 2 Spell three times per battle, and
                    a level 1 Spell as many times as they want. The Spells are stored in a type-specific ArrayList
                    called SpellBook and will reset every time a new Battle starts. The ArrayList will contain the
                    number of level 2 and level 3 Spells that the Player is allowed to use that round. If the player has
                    not unlocked level 3 Spells, then there will be no level 3 Spells in the ArrayList. Since the Player
                    can use as many level 1 Spells as they want, they are not included in the ArrayList. I will use
                    sequential search to locate and remove the proper Spell from the ArrayList. Damage will be
                    calculated using the random() method from the Math Class and will be stored in the Wizard class.

                    <br>
                    A Player will fight 10 battles of Monsters before reaching the final boss. A player may deploy one
                    Wizard at a time and will fight against a maximum of three Monsters at a time. The Battle class will
                    contain information about the levels and if the Player knows any of the vulnerabilities or
                    weaknesses of any of the deployed Monsters. If the Player knows any of the vulnerabilities of the
                    Monsters on the Field, The Battle class will contain an array of booleans which will be true if the
                    Player is on that level and will turn false after they beat it. The battle will loop switching
                    between who’s turn it is during the battle until all Monsters or all Wizards are dead. The Wizards
                    that are not being used have their HP (hit points) while another Wizard is deployed but their level
                    does not increase. If a Player has found out the vulnerabilities or resistances of a Monster during
                    a previous level, they will be notified before the battle starts and before they choose their Wizard
                    to deploy to battle. If a Wizard dies in battle they will be able to be revived once per round. If a
                    Wizard falls, the Player can choose to revive the Wizard to full health and continue the battle
                    where they left off or deploy a different Wizard. The final boss battle will allow the Player to
                    deploy all Wizards at full health and at the levels they finished at. The final boss does not have
                    any vulnerabilities and will have increased HP and attack damages. Defeating the final boss will
                    result in a win and the game will end.


                    <br>
                    <h4>Class Descriptions</h4>
                    <strong>Character</strong> is an interface that has the methods for a Wizard and a Monster.
                    <br>
                    A <strong>Wizard</strong> is a class that implements the Character interface. A Wizard has an HP,
                    elemental class,
                    level, Spells, life status, special skill, Spell slots, and deployed status. There are four
                    elemental classes for each Wizard: fire, ice, necrotic, and radiant. The starter Wizard will be a
                    fire elemental, second ice, third necrotic, and fourth radiant. A Wizard can have a level from 1-5
                    (HP scaling in the table below). Every time a Wizard drops a Monster’s HP to 0, their level
                    increases based on the chart below. Every time a Wizard is hit, they take damage and it is
                    subtracted from their total HP. If a Wizard’s HP drops to 0, their life status is changed and they
                    can revive a Wizard once every battle. If they have already revived a Wizard during that battle,
                    they will no longer be able to deploy that Wizard until the next battle. At the final battle, all
                    four Wizards will be deployed at full health and will fight at whatever level the Player increased
                    them by. A Wizard can only cast a level 3 Spell twice per battle, a level 2 Spell three times per
                    battle, and a level 1 Spell as many times as they want.

                    <br>
                    A <strong>Spell</strong> has an elemental type, max and min damage, and level. Spells can have a
                    level 1-3. The
                    damage range of Spells is specified in the tables below. A Spell can have an elemental type of fire,
                    ice, necrotic, and radiant.
                    <br>
                    A Monster has a level, vulnerability, resistance, HP, attacks, life status, and deployed status. A
                    Monster can have a level of 1-3 except for the final boss which has a level of 10 (HP scaling in the
                    table below). A Monster will also have 1 vulnerability and 1 resistance (specified in the table
                    below). If a Monster is hit with an attack with an elemental type they are vulnerable to, they will
                    receive double damage. If a Monster is hit with an attack with an elemental type they are resistant
                    to, they will receive half the damage. The Player is not notified if a Monster is hit with an attack
                    they are vulnerable or resistant to unless they use their action to check it. If a Monster’s HP
                    drops to 0, its life status and deployed status are updated and the Player’s level is increased
                    accordingly (HP and level increase specified below). The Monster will attack the active Wizard after
                    the Player takes an action regardless of what action they take (attack scaling specified in the
                    table below). A Monster does not have an elemental attack type and only does basic slashing attacks.

                    <br>
                    The Player has a type-specific ArrayList of Wizards. The Player will start off with one fire-type
                    Wizard and will gain a second, third, and fourth Wizard in their corresponding levels. A Player can
                    deploy only one Wizard at a time until the final battle. A Player can take 6 actions during a
                    battle: swap Wizard, check vulnerability, check resistance, use special skill, skip a turn, or
                    forfeit. The Monster will still attack regardless of the action they take during their turn.
                    <br>
                    The Battle class contains a level, number of Monsters, turn, vulnerabilities and resistances pop-up,
                    end battle variable, and defeated variable. The levels can go from 1-11, 11 being the final boss,
                    and after the game would end. If the Player loses all Wizards during a battle the game will end and
                    the Player can choose to start again. There should also be a pop-up notification every time a battle
                    starts that indicates the vulnerabilities and resistances of each Monster type on the battlefield if
                    the Player has already used it on that specific Monster before. There should also be a certain
                    amount of Monsters on each level 1-3 Monsters from levels 1-3 (specified in the table below) in
                    levels 1-10. Level 11 will contain the final boss who has a level 10. Players and Monsters take
                    turns. A Player always starts a battle and can choose from their 6 options. A Monster will always
                    attack its turn. If all the Monsters have been defeated then the end battle variable will be true
                    and the next Battle will begin. If the Player’s Wizards have been defeated, then the defeated
                    variable will be set to true, and the game will end and ask the Player if they want to start again
                    from level 1.
