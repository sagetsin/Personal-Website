                The WiC RPG Arcade Game was created by the WiC Projects Team of Fall 2024 for the arcade cabinet in the WiC space.
                This RPG has a cat character that explores different areas associated with RIT's identity. Some of these areas
                include the National Technical Institute of the Deaf (NTID), the Golisano College of Computing and Information Science
                Building (GCCIS), Wallace Library, and others. I worked on the NTID level with Natalie Zesch and Claire O'Farrell.

                The game for the NTID level was matching the ASL alphabet hand sign to the letter to spell out
                a word associated with NTID or RIT. This is a simple and fun game that can help the player learn
                and understand ASL.
                <br>
                The ASL alphabet is the foundation to learning ASL. The National Institute for the Deaf (NTID) is the world's largest
                technological college for deaf and hard-of-hearing students in the world, and is located at our very own
                Rochester Institute of Technology. NTID offers associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees in more than 200 programs
                offered by RIT, along with one of the most accessible education communities in the world for deaf and hard-of hearing
                students. AAudiology and speech language services and cutting-edge accessibility solutions are available,
                along with accessible facilities and an inclusive community.
                <h4>Concept Development</h4>
                There were several concepts we were deciding between for the game for the NITD level. We wanted it to have some
                aspects of the deaf-community while also being informational. At first, we wanted to have the letters given
                then have them try to choose the ASL letters to match. If we had more time, that could be plausible, but
                it would also take some time to draw all the hand signs.
                <br>
                The game would start with the player talking to an interpreter who would explain the rules of the game.
                Once the player "talked" with the interpreter, then the puzzle would appear and the player could use WASD
                to move and the space bar to change between letters. Since it is for an arcade game, we didn't incorporate any
                logic that would require clicking with a mouse.
                <br>
                If the configuration was incorrect then the interpreter would not let you pass. If it was correct, then the
                barrier would open to the next level and you would be able to move on. We planned on having 5 or so levels, but due
                to time constraints, we were only able to fully flesh out two. In the future, we hope to develop this game further
                and incorporate more features and levels.
                <br>
                <h4>Designing the Game</h4>
                Some of the features we needed to create was the interpreter and hiding the puzzle until they arrive, the text
                dialog for the interpreter, puzzle configurations and verification, and moving to other levels.
                <br><strong>Hiding the Puzzle</strong>
                The way we did this was just having the visibility turned off until the player entered the collision shape
                of the interpreter and pressed space. This is just a stop-gap until we incorporate the dialog that was developed
                in a separate branch.
                <br><strong>Text Dialog</strong>
                The text dialog was created by one of my teammates, so I am not familiar with how she worked it out. But it
                works as expected.
                <br><strong>Puzzle Configurations and Verification</strong>
                The state was measured by the frame the sprite was on for an animated sprite. If the state was correct for
                each box, then when the player went to the interpreter to verify, it would let them pass. Otherwise, it would
                not do anything. The functionality we want to implement is that it will give you a hint and tell you that your
                configuration is wrong.
                <br><strong>Moving to other levels</strong>
                We had hoped to have more levels but two are fleshed out right now. There is a barrier preventing the player from
                moving on until they have verified their solution with the interpreter. An arrow appears to direct the player
                to the right exit as well. After the player exits the screen, a fade to black animation plays and the player
                appears at the opposite end of the next level and the interpreter is there too.
                <h4>Visuals</h4>
                The TileMap, Player, and interpreter were provided with the texture pack we were provided. The only other
                graphics that we needed to create were the arrow, hand signs, and letters. Natalie Zesch created the letters.

                <img class="article-img" src="../../media/images/wic-asl.png" alt="asl"><br>
                <h4>Challenges we Encountered</h4>
                We had an impossible time trying to figure out the TileMaps. It was all glitched out and weird for a very long
                time. I tried to use the bitmap from the grass and that may have been why it wasn't working. I had to manually
                configure the grid and afterward we were able to create a cohesive map.
                <br>
                It was also challenging to figure out the fade to black since I never dealt with CanvasLayers. It still is
                not working exactly as intended since the animation isn't long enough for the time it takes for the player
                to get to the other side of the map.
