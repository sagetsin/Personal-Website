                Wizard Battle is a Game that allows a <code>Player</code> to play a <code>Wizard</code> and unlock three
                other
                <code>Wizards</code> to fight off <code>Monsters</code> in a turn-based RPG-style battle. There are
                three
                types of <code>Monsters</code>
                from level 1 to level 3 difficulty and the final boss.

                A <code>Player</code> can increase the level of a <code>Wizard</code> by +1 after defeating three level
                1 <code>Monsters</code> defeating
                two level 2 <code>Monsters</code> , or one level 3 Monster. Each <code>Monster</code> has its own
                vulnerabilities to certain
                elemental types and resistances. A <code>Player</code> can take a possibility of 6 actions during a
                battle: swap
                <code>Wizard</code>, check vulnerability, check resistance, use a special skill, skip a turn, or
                forfeit;
                however, they can only choose one. The <code>Monster</code> will still attack regardless of the action
                they take
                during their turn. They can also use their special skill which will cause a <code>Monster</code> to be
                vulnerable
                to a specific element at level 4. When hit with an elemental type a <code>Monster</code> is vulnerable
                to, they
                will deal double damage. When hit with an elemental type a <code>Monster</code> is resistant to, they
                will deal
                half damage.
                <br>
                A <code>Wizard</code> can have a level from 1-5. Each <code>Wizard</code> can cast <code>Spells</code>
                of a specific elemental type. Each
                wizard has three <code>Spells</code>: a level 1 Spell, a level 2 Spell, and a level 3 <code>Spell</code>.
                The <code>Player</code> has
                access to their level 1 <code>Spell</code> from levels 1-5, level 2 <code>Spells</code> from 2-5, and
                level 3 <code>Spells</code> from 4-5.
                A <code>Wizard</code> can only cast a level 3 <code>Spell</code> twice per battle, a level 2
                <code>Spell</code> three times per battle, and
                a level 1 <code>Spell</code> as many times as they want. The <code>Spells</code> are stored in a
                type-specific ArrayList
                called SpellBook and will reset every time a new <code>Battle</code> starts. The ArrayList will contain
                the
                number of level 2 and level 3 <code>Spells</code> that the <code>Player</code> is allowed to use that
                round. If the player has
                not unlocked level 3 <code>Spells</code>, then there will be no level 3 <code>Spells</code> in the
                ArrayList. Since the <code>Player</code>
                can use as many level 1 <code>Spells</code> as they want, they are not included in the ArrayList. I will
                use
                sequential search to locate and remove the proper <code>Spell</code> from the ArrayList. Damage will be
                calculated using the random() method from the Math Class and will be stored in the <code>Wizard</code>
                class.

                <br>
                A <code>Player</code> will fight 10 battles of <code>Monsters</code> before reaching the final boss. A
                player may deploy one
                <code>Wizard</code> at a time and will fight against a maximum of three <code>Monsters</code> at a time.
                The <code>Battle</code> class will
                contain information about the levels and if the <code>Player</code> knows any of the vulnerabilities or
                weaknesses of any of the deployed <code>Monsters</code> . If the <code>Player</code> knows any of the
                vulnerabilities of the
                <code>Monsters</code> on the Field, The <code>Battle</code> class will contain an array of booleans
                which will be true if the
                <code>Player</code> is on that level and will turn false after they beat it. The battle will loop
                switching
                between who’s turn it is during the battle until all <code>Monsters</code> or all <code>Wizards</code>
                are dead. The <code>Wizards</code>
                that are not being used have their HP (hit points) while another <code>Wizard</code> is deployed but
                their level
                does not increase. If a <code>Player</code> has found out the vulnerabilities or resistances of a <code>Monster</code>
                during
                a previous level, they will be notified before the battle starts and before they choose their Wizard
                to deploy to battle. If a <code>Wizard</code> dies in battle they will be able to be revived once per
                round. If a
                <code>Wizard</code> falls, the <code>Player</code> can choose to revive the <code>Wizard</code> to full
                health and continue the battle
                where they left off or deploy a different Wizard. The final boss battle will allow the
                <code>Player</code> to
                deploy all <code>Wizards</code> at full health and at the levels they finished at. The final boss does
                not have
                any vulnerabilities and will have increased HP and attack damages. Defeating the final boss will
                result in a win and the game will end.


                <br>
                <h4>Class Descriptions</h4>
                <code>Character</code> is an interface that has the methods for a <code>Wizard</code> and a Monster.
                <br>
                A <code>Wizard</code> is a class that implements the Character interface. A <code>Wizard</code> has an
                HP,
                elemental class,
                level, <code>Spells</code>, life status, special skill, <code>Spell</code> slots, and deployed status.
                There are four
                elemental classes for each Wizard: fire, ice, necrotic, and radiant. The starter <code>Wizard</code>
                will be a
                fire elemental, second ice, third necrotic, and fourth radiant. A <code>Wizard</code> can have a level
                from 1-5
                (HP scaling in the table below). Every time a <code>Wizard</code> drops a Monster’s HP to 0, their level
                increases based on the chart below. Every time a <code>Wizard</code> is hit, they take damage and it is
                subtracted from their total HP. If a Wizard’s HP drops to 0, their life status is changed and they
                can revive a <code>Wizard</code> once every battle. If they have already revived a <code>Wizard</code>
                during that battle,
                they will no longer be able to deploy that <code>Wizard</code> until the next battle. At the final
                battle, all
                four <code>Wizards</code> will be deployed at full health and will fight at whatever level the <code>Player</code>
                increased
                them by. A <code>Wizard</code> can only cast a level 3 <code>Spell</code> twice per battle, a level 2
                <code>Spell</code> three times per
                battle, and a level 1 <code>Spell</code> as many times as they want.

                <br>
                A <strong>Spell</strong> has an elemental type, max and min damage, and level. <code>Spells</code> can
                have a
                level 1-3. The
                damage range of <code>Spells</code> is specified in the tables below. A <code>Spell</code> can have an
                elemental type of fire,
                ice, necrotic, and radiant.
                <br>
                A <code>Monster</code> has a level, vulnerability, resistance, HP, attacks, life status, and deployed
                status. A
                <code>Monster</code> can have a level of 1-3 except for the final boss which has a level of 10 (HP
                scaling in the
                table below). A <code>Monster</code> will also have 1 vulnerability and 1 resistance (specified in the
                table
                below). If a <code>Monster</code> is hit with an attack with an elemental type they are vulnerable to,
                they will
                receive double damage. If a <code>Monster</code> is hit with an attack with an elemental type they are
                resistant
                to, they will receive half the damage. The <code>Player</code> is not notified if a <code>Monster</code>
                is hit with an attack
                they are vulnerable or resistant to unless they use their action to check it. If a Monster’s HP
                drops to 0, its life status and deployed status are updated and the <code>Player</code>’s level is
                increased
                accordingly (HP and level increase specified below). The <code>Monster</code> will attack the active
                <code>Wizard</code> after
                the <code>Player</code> takes an action regardless of what action they take (attack scaling specified in
                the
                table below). A <code>Monster</code> does not have an elemental attack type and only does basic slashing
                attacks.

                <br>
                The <code>Player</code> has a type-specific ArrayList of <code>Wizards</code> . The <code>Player</code>
                will start off with one fire-type
                <code>Wizard</code> and will gain a second, third, and fourth <code>Wizard</code> in their corresponding
                levels. A <code>Player</code> can
                deploy only one <code>Wizard</code> at a time until the final battle. A <code>Player</code> can take 6
                actions during a
                battle: swap Wizard, check vulnerability, check resistance, use special skill, skip a turn, or
                forfeit. The <code>Monster</code> will still attack regardless of the action they take during their
                turn.
                <br>
                The <code>Battle</code> class contains a level, number of <code>Monsters</code> , turn, vulnerabilities
                and resistances pop-up,
                end battle variable, and defeated variable. The levels can go from 1-11, 11 being the final boss,
                and after the game would end. If the <code>Player</code> loses all <code>Wizards</code> during a battle
                the game will end and
                the <code>Player</code> can choose to start again. There should also be a pop-up notification every time
                a battle
                starts that indicates the vulnerabilities and resistances of each <code>Monster</code> type on the
                battlefield if
                the <code>Player</code> has already used it on that specific <code>Monster</code> before. There should
                also be a certain
                amount of <code>Monsters</code> on each level 1-3 <code>Monsters</code> from levels 1-3 (specified in
                the table below) in
                levels 1-10. Level 11 will contain the final boss who has a level 10. Players and <code>Monsters</code>
                take
                turns. A <code>Player</code> always starts a battle and can choose from their 6 options. A
                <code>Monster</code> will always
                attack its turn. If all the <code>Monsters</code> have been defeated then the end battle variable will
                be true
                and the next <code>Battle</code> will begin. If the <code>Player</code>’s <code>Wizards</code> have been
                defeated, then the defeated
                variable will be set to true, and the game will end and ask the <code>Player</code> if they want to
                start again
                from level 1.
